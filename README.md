Alright, so for now here's the deal:

In Android directory, RabbitmqTestProject holds the Android Studio project I have that is for sending simple messages to the https server using RequestPusher class.

In Server directory there is RabbitMQTests project which is an intellij community project. This is the meat of the current server prototype stuff. All the classes in the src directory of that project represent my current testing work.
